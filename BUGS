Closing the stock addition or deletion windows have been reported to
cause random segmentation violation under Linux. This appears to be a 
bug in Perl/Tk which will hopefully be solved, or circumvented, soon. 
This bug does not bite under Solaris, FreeBSD or NT. 
[ UPDATE: It also seems to have disappeared under Perl 5.6.*. ]

Problems with undefined symbols have been reported under Solaris 2.6 
when Perl has been compiled with thread support. Using an unthreaded 
Perl binary under Solaris works. How this problem can be circumvented is
presently unclear.
