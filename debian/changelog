      than year, also due to Robert A. Schmied.

  * New major release:
  
    - In 'gallery' mode, smtm now updates chart windows along with the 
      normal data allowing for automatically updated intra-daily or
      intra-weekly charts (longer horizons are updated less frequently

      the command-line option '--gallery', or via the Chart->Gallery
      menu entry.
  
    - Small updates to documentation

    - smtm: correct small error where defensive assignment of number of
      share was not used

      seems to trip up some 5.8.* versions of Perl. Thanks to Bruce Bowler
      for reporting this
  
    - smtm: use LWP::UserAgent->new(), not RequestAgent->new(), as this seems
      to trip up some ActiveState version. Thanks to Chris Eidem and others
      for reporting this.

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Oct 2003 20:47:06 -0500

      memory hole
  
    - Makefile.PL: Depend on MIME::Base64
  
    - debian/control: Depends: on libmime-base64-perl | perl (>= 5.8.0)
      [ MIME::Base64 is a package with perl 5.6.*, but included in 5.8.* ]

    - Quote information code has been outsourced to Finance::YahooQuote

      still made) as well as most of the content of the new example
      file indices.smtm
  
    - Updated documentation accordingly

smtm (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following code changes:

    - generalised country support: as Yahoo! now appears to serve

      bucket for different global regions -- the net effect is that
      we should now have global coverage
