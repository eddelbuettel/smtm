 * Keep the information retrieved and have a details window with high/low
   bid/ask volume .... Would make more sense if Yahoo! UK gave as much detail
   as Yahoo! NA does.  
 ==> DONE as of 0.5.1 

 * Maybe not keep the stocks selected simply in @ARGV, but a global hash and
   also keep a number of shares for each symbol to that we get hard dollar
   changes for the portfolio 
 ==> DONE as of 0.6.0

 * By the same token, also store the reference currency. The file format
   would then be a comma (or whatever) separated list like
	BT.A.L,100,EUR
	BCE.TO,200,CAD
   or maybe use the Yahoo currency ticker?  
 ==> DONE as of 0.6.0

 * And then again, maybe allow for a text string as well to overcome the 
   lacking name string when using the non-US site. Ergo:
        BT.A.L,100,EUR,British Telecom
 ==> DONE as of 0.5.2

 * User request: Right-mouse click on button to launch browser on Yahoo page 
     ==> maybe, but Yahoo UK doesn't show a chart anyway
 ==> DONE as of 0.8.0,  didn't even need an external browser. Perl/Tk rules.

 * User request: Allow for purchase price to show total return
     ==> needed in a stock ticker ?
         should also allow for purchase date for annualised return
 ==> DONE as of 0.9.9

 *  User request: Do not update between 9 and 5, say
     ==> conflict with local timezones in NA and, say European trading hours
         maybe add cmd line option for an expression that will be eval'ed ?

 *  Timeout variable
 ==> DONE as of 0.8.2

 *  Button preference variable
 ==> DONE as of 0.8.2

 *  The "stock detail" window should include how much it contributed to net
    loss/gain for the day, if appropriate, along with all "other" information
    like nb of shares, position value etc. 
 ==> as of 0.8.3, provides nb of shares, position value and change value

 *  Would be nice to reorganize smtm so that several windows could be updated
    from one session, rather than running several Perl sessions

 *  Would be nice to have a few (intra-day) chart windows update automatically

 *  (From a discussion with Jon Solworth) Would be nice to set the background
    of individual entries to distinguish "thematically"

 *  Should drop the ad-hoc configurarion reading/writing code and probably
    use one of the Config:: modules from CPAN
