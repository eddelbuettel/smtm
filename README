	     smtm --- A global stock ticker for X11 and Windoze


1. Introduction
   
   smtm, which is a not overly clever acronym for Show Me The Money, is a
   financial ticker and portfolio application for quotes from exchanges
   around the world (provided they are carried on Yahoo!). It creates and 
   automatically updates a window with quotes from Yahoo! Finance. It can 
   also display the entire variety of charts available at Yahoo! Finance. 
   When called with one or several symbols, it displays these selected
   stocks. When smtm is called without arguments, it reads the symbols
   tickers from a file, by default ~/.smtmrc. This file can be created
   explicitly by calling the Save option from the File menu. Beyond stocks,
   smtm can also display currencies (from the Philadephia exchange), US
   mutual funds, options on US stocks, several precious metals and quite
   possibly more; see the Yahoo! Finance website for full information. 


2. How to get started
   
   Built using Perl/Tk it requires at least the following modules
   
   	  Date::Manip
	  Finance::YahooQuote
	  LWP::UserAgent
	  MIME::Base64
	  HTML::Parser
	  Tk	
          Tk::PNG

   all of which are readily available for most Unix variants, Linux
   distributions and the ActiveState Perl implementation common on win*.
   
   Debian users just say 'apt-get install smtm'. 

   For others, and following Perl convention, the installation should work as

         perl Makefile.PL # optionally "perl Makefile.PL verbose"
         make
	 make test	  # the tests are somewhat limited	 
         make install     

   but I do not test this regularly as I install the Debian packages myself.
   

3. How to use it

   'smtm --help' gives a brief synopis, 'perldoc smtm' shows the full manual 
   page.  Several options are available and can be set from both a resource
   file ~/.smtmrc, the command-line and the menus once smtm is running.

   Additional resource files, e.g. for additional portfolios, are available
   in the examples/ directory of the source distribution.

   But the simplest case is possibly to just supply ticker symbols on the 
   command-line:  'smtm DELL IBM MSFT'.
